# Generate data from big dataset dblp

We deal with the data set dblp which has more than 4 million lines of the publishing papers and the authors information. 

http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/

We mainly want to get two files, first is the author name with one id number, the other is a weighted graph which means the pubilished papers number that two authors have co-authored together.
